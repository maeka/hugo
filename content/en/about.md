# Hello, I’m Ricardo Maekawa

I’m a Brazilian digital strategist and SEO professional with a background in programming, technical writing and data analytics.  I have been working on the web since 1997 and have helped websites grow high‑quality organic traffic since 2008.

## Professional Journey

I currently lead the SEO strategy at Remessa Online (BeeTech).  Since joining in 2019, I have scaled the company’s organic traffic from roughly 40 k to over 2.2 million clicks per month, positioning the domain among the top 220 sites in Brazil by organic audience.  I built a multidisciplinary team spanning SEO, content, CRO and product and made sure SEO was considered early in UX and product development.

Before that, I served as Head of SEO at the media group Abril (2008–2015).  There I designed frameworks for large‑scale editorial operations and achieved around 165 k keywords on the first page of Google.  I also held roles as Marketing Analyst at Empiricus Research (2015–2018) and BI Analyst at InfoMoney (2018).  Earlier in my career, I worked as a consultant and information architect for internet portals and evaluated search results quality for Google, experiences that shaped my technical perspective on search.

## Publications & Early Days

My journey started in the late 1990s creating websites and writing for specialised tech magazines.  In the early 2000s I contributed articles about XML, XSLT, Ajax, PHP and web architecture to *Revista do Web Master* and founded *Revista Científica*, a small independent publication exploring technical and scientific essays.  These early experiences fed my passion for sharing knowledge and connecting technology with people.

## Education & Skills

I hold an MBA in Economics and Management with a focus on Business Analytics and Big Data from FGV, and studied Geology/Earth Sciences and Journalism.  In recent years I have developed machine‑learning‑driven models for content classification and search behaviour, bridging data science and SEO.  I’m fluent in Portuguese and speak English professionally.

## Beyond Work

When I’m not optimising websites, I enjoy exploring the messy side of creativity.  SEO, to me, is both art and science – a blend of structured analysis and intuition.  In my **Funny Facts** PDF below, you can get a glimpse of the quirky articles I wrote in my early days.  You can also download my full résumé with publications if you want to dive deeper into my professional background.
