## ⚡️ How to make a web page 2s faster and gain +15 PageSpeed points

**SEOLANDIA.**  
A lot happens between the moment you type a URL and hit **Enter**, and the moment the page actually shows up on your screen.

Optimizing page speed is about optimizing **time**.

And time is one of the most valuable assets there is.

## How much is one second of a user’s life worth?

The last thing you want after clicking a link is:

- a blank screen  
- frozen  
- for a few seconds  
- with no feedback at all  

We’ve all been there.

I ran this optimization in the real world — and the result was **+15 PageSpeed points** and a page **~2 seconds faster**.

## What I learned along the way 👇

### 🚫 What slows your page down

- 🚫 **CSS** and **JS** files loaded in the `<head>` block rendering
- 🚫 Too many external files in the header make it even worse
- 🚫 Three CSS files are slower than a single one
- 🚫 Large file sizes directly impact load time

---

### ✅ What actually helps

- ✅ The first thing your page should deliver is **content**, not a download queue
- ✅ Extracting and inlining **critical CSS** dramatically improves First Paint
- ✅ Unused CSS also wastes time and should be removed

## Critical CSS: the real game changer

To extract critical CSS, you can use:

- **Critical**, a Node.js-based solution  
- or online tools that automate this process  

The idea is simple:  
👉 give the browser only the CSS needed to render the first viewport.

Everything else can wait.

## Final thoughts

Performance is not just a technical metric.  
It’s **UX**, **perception**, and **respect for the user’s time**.

2 seconds matter.  
15 PageSpeed points matter too.

Happy clicks. 🚀
