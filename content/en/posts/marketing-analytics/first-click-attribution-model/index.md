## “How did you find out about our brand?”

This question has been around for decades.

It has appeared in:
- surveys  
- signup forms  
- brand awareness research  
- post-purchase questionnaires  

Before modern analytics, **this was the only way to measure discovery**.

Today, it has a technical name:

## **First-click attribution model**

## What first-click attribution really measures

First-click attribution answers one simple question:

> **What was the very first touchpoint between the user and the brand?**

It’s not about conversion.  
It’s not about closing.  
It’s about **discovery**.

It tells you:
- where this person came from
- which channel opened the door
- who introduced the brand first

## The role of SEO in growth loops

SEO does not exist to “close the deal”.

The strategic role of SEO is:
> **bringing new people to the pub’s door.**

SEO:
- introduces the brand
- puts it on the user’s radar
- starts the relationship

Measuring SEO only by last click is judging the doorman by the cash register.

## Why this is the most important attribution model

First-click attribution is:

- ✅ the best model to evaluate **SEO**
- ✅ the most appropriate for **brand awareness**
- ✅ ideal for top-of-funnel campaigns
- ✅ essential for sustainable growth analysis

Without it, you may grow —  
but you won’t know **why**.

## What happens when you ignore it

When first-click attribution is ignored:

- SEO seems to “not convert”
- awareness campaigns look inefficient
- decisions become short-term driven
- growth turns into noise

You keep investing…  
but you stop learning.

## Analytics is not just conversion, it’s memory

First-click attribution is the system’s memory.

It preserves the answer to a very old and powerful question:

> **How did you find out about us?**

Those who ignore it measure sales.  
Those who understand it measure growth.

**Happy clicks.**
