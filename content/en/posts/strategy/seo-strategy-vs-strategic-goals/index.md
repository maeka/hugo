## SEO Strategy vs. SEO Strategic Goals

SEO **Strategic Goals** can be understood as the topics a website should appear for in search engines in order to be considered truly present in its niche.

**SEO Strategy**, in turn, is the clear and deliberate plan that defines *how* that website will reach those goals.

To draft a solid SEO strategy, here’s a practical starting point:

1. **Recognize the search patterns** of the queries you want the website to rank for  
2. **Understand which page templates** should serve each subset of that query universe  

Every niche has its own particularities, and for obvious reasons, those nuances can only be addressed case by case.

Still, there are recurring **characteristics, behaviors, expectations, and structural “shapes”** shared by almost every triangulation between the **user**, the **search query**, and the **webpage**.

## 🔍 The focus of user intent

Search queries naturally move from **broad to narrow**.

A useful way to visualize this movement, and connect it to SEO strategy, is to think in terms of **zoom levels**:

- **Zoom-out pages** help exploration (home, categories, lists)
- **Zoom-in pages** help precision (articles, products, single media pages)

When someone performs a **broad search**, they expect a page capable of exposing *as much of the website’s content inventory as possible* related to that topic.

The right templates for this type of query are those that offer **multiple entry points** to content.

This pairing between **broad queries** and **zoom-out pages** tends to show:

- A **high bounce rate is bad**, since the expected behavior is exploratory  
- Queries with **1–2 terms**, often **abstract nouns**  
- The **highest search volume** in the niche  
- Alignment with Google’s **“Know” queries** framing

## 🔎 Narrow queries and focused pages

For **narrow queries**, the logic flips.

Here, the user knows exactly what they want.

The template that best serves this intent should focus on **a single editorial cut at a time**.

These templates usually look like:
- Article pages  
- News articles  
- Single video pages  
- Single photo pages  
- Product pages  

At this point, precision beats breadth — and clarity beats navigation.
