## In search of the perfect match

Not every SEO problem is about **weak content**, **links**, or **technical issues**.

Sometimes, the real issue is simpler — and deeper:

👉 **the search and the page are not talking about the same thing.**

Let’s look at two very common scenarios.

---

## When the search is broader than the page

Imagine someone searches for:

> **[energy sector stocks on B3]**

And lands on a page showing **only Petrobras’ stock price (PETR4)**.

What happened here?

- The **search intent is broad**
- The **page is narrow**
- The user wanted a *set*
- They got a *single item*

Google may test this result, but it rarely lasts.

---

## When the page is broader than the search

Now the opposite case.

The user searches for:

> **[Petrobras stock]**

And lands on a page listing **all energy sector stocks on B3**.

Here:

- The **search intent is specific**
- The **page is broad**
- The user wanted an *item*
- They got a *universe*

Again: misalignment.

---

## What failed in both scenarios?

In both cases, one crucial thing didn’t happen:

## ❌ The *EXACT MATCH*

Exact match is not about keyword repetition.  
It’s about aligning **three things at once**:

1. **Search intent**
2. **Page scope**
3. **User expectation**

When these overlap, Google understands:
> “This page is exactly what this search is asking for.”

---

## How do you fix this?

Some practical questions help a lot:

- Is this page about **one entity** or **a full category**?
- Should this URL rank for **broad terms** or **specific terms**?
- Is there another page that better matches this intent?
- Should this page exist — or should it become a *hub*?

Most of the time, the solution is not “optimize harder”,  
but **organize smarter**.

---

## SEO is a relationship, not a trick

When the match happens:
- users stay
- Google persists
- rankings stabilize

When it doesn’t:
- clicks bounce
- tests end
- URLs rotate

**Happy clicks.**
